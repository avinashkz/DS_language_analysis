# DS Language Analysis

In this data analysis project, we aim to understand how the choice of programming language is affected by the preference of a data science task. 

## Question

Does someone's favorite data science task have an effect on their choice between R and Python?

## Variables

* Programming Language
	* Python
	* R

* Data science task
	* Wrangling
	* Visualization
	* Machine Learning


## Confounding variables

* Academic background
	* Computer Science/Computer Engineering
	* Mathematics/Statistics
	* Other

We think the academic background would be a confounding variable as people with Computer Science/Computer Engineering background would have been introduced to Python as part of their degree and R would have been introduced to students of Mathematics/Statistics degrees. However, we do not anticipate any bias towards R or Python by students of any other degrees.

	
## Statistical Analysis

For the statistical analysis, we are planning to use Generalized Linear Model(GLM) as the response variable is discrete and we have more than two groups when we consider the confounding variable.


## UBC Office of Research Ethics guidelines pertaining to our surveys 


* As a part of our survey, if our online survey company 
 is outside Canada, we will inform the respondents about the same.


*  As a part of our survey, we assure no personal information will be collected during the survey study like (Student no, Name). To avoid directly identifying the respondents

* As a part of our survey, we will ensure individual identity will be protected as per UBC and FIPP research guidelines
